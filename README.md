Analyze stocks for Steve

## Purpose
Review of green energy investments. 

### Background
Objective is to find funds that would be good targets to diversify investments for Steve's parents who are already committed to investing in DAQO. They are interested in the total daily volume and yearly return for each of these stocks. They believe if a stock is traded often the price will accurately reflect the value. 

#### Results
Looking at the years 2017 and 2018 there were 12 stocks evaluated. Overall 2017 was a good year for most of them, while the opposite was true in 2018.

Comparison of running the analysis with the original script and the refracted script.

Length of time it too for the code to run for 2017:

The refracted script runs much quicker and more efficient. 

##### Summary
1. As you can see running the refracted script saves space and also is much quicker which would be important if you were running this script on thousands of stocks. Running the refracted script also takes less steps but does involve more conditions and nested loops. This makes the code easier to read for future users. A disadvantage of refractoring would be if the application is big or if a developer doesn't have a firm grasp of what they are looking to find.
2. For this pariticular case refractoring cut the time to run the code by 75% to 80%. The downside, is writing the code took more in depth knowledge of using conditionals and if-then statements.
